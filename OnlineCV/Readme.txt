The OnlineCV project is developed on Visual studio express for web 2013 mainly using below technologies.

Aspnet.MVC5
Bootstrap
AngularJS

How it works !

All the CV contents are in /Contents/mycv.json. 
The js /Scripts/onlinecv-angular.js will read the mycv.json and load it into angular scope.
Then angular scope has been bind on html tags for the .cshtml pages as required. 
In this project i have used only 1 angular app and 1 controller. 

Boostrap grid has been used to arrange the layouts, 

Javascript/JQuery related to this controllers are written under /Scripts/Controllers/



Thanks
